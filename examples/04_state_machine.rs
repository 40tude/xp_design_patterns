// cargo run --example 04_state_machine

// Implements a finite state machine (FSM) in Rust.
// This example models a process that moves through three states:
//     Validated → Enriched → Persisted
// The transition between states is triggered by an input event (Event::Process).

// This example shows how to create a flexible and type-safe FSM using traits and dynamic dispatch.
// Each state is a struct that implements a shared trait called `State`.
// We use `Box<dyn State>` to hold the current state and allow transitions between different types.
// The main loop continues until the FSM reaches a terminal state.

// This approach make sense if:
//      The states have very different behaviors.
//      You want to allow other crates to add states.
//      You need to store different data in each state.

// There is a simpler and faster approach based on enum and match expression

use std::fmt::Debug;

// Define the possible events the FSM can handle.
// In this simple example, there's only one event: Process.
#[derive(Clone, Debug)]
pub enum Event {
    Process,
}

// Define the State trait that all states must implement.
// - handle: defines how the state reacts to an event and transitions to the next state.
// - name: returns the name of the current state as a string for logging and comparison.
